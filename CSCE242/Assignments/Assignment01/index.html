        <h1>Chocolate Chip Cookies</h1>

            <!--required p1-->
            <p>While we're all entitled to our own opinions on what the best dessert option is out there,
            no one can deny that the chocolate chip cookie is a classic sweet. Such a classic in fact,
            that we have many, many ways to obtain them, from buying cheap ones made in a factory for 
            a snack to spending hours making dozens from scratch for an event. Either way, they're 
            going to be eaten, and they're going to be enjoyed. On top of the many ways to get them
            are the many ways to bake them. So many grandmas have their own recipe. Search "chocolate 
            chip cookie recipe" on the internet and you'll be reading for days. Most of them start off
            with the same base ingredients, such as the following:
            </p>
            <!--ordered list-->
            <ol>
                <li>Flour</li>
                <li>Butter</li>
                <li>Sugar</li>
                <li>Chocolate chips <i>or</i> chunks</li>
            </ol>

            <!--required p2-->
            <p>But they start differentiating when we add more elements. Do you use salt, baking soda, eggs? How much of 
                each ingredient? How long do you chill the dough, if it gets chilled at all? Portion size? Baking time? 
                While there's no objectively "best" chocolate chip cookie recipe, I'd like to take the time to compare two 
                that demonstrates that more is sometimes better(though to what degree is more subjective). Here is a link 
                to a recipe called the <a href= "https://www.ihearteating.com/easiest-chocolate-chip-cookie-recipe/">Easiest Chocolate Chip Cookies.</a>
                While they're definitely delicious, as any chocolate chip cookie is, I find that they're more of a good
                fix for a craving.</p>
                
            <p>When you're looking for a superb chocolate chip cookie, putting in the work for it really does make a world 
                of difference regarding taste. Here is a link to a review of the 
                <a href= "https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/1culmbl/the_statue_of_cookbook_perfection_cooking_every/?rdt=58823">Stardew Valley Chocolate Chip Cookies</a>
                , which are a staple in my kitchen. They are a recipe from the Stardew Valley Cookbook, a cookbook based on 
                food items found in the game Stardew Valley. I seem to make a plate of them every month or so because they 
                are simply amazing. Browning the butter for a nutty, almost pretzel-like flavor, adding ground oats to the 
                flour for more texture, just the right balance of salt, these are hands-down the best chocolate chip cookies 
                I've ever had. The biggest issue is that they are a labor of love. The eggs need to be room-temperature; 
                the dough needs to chill, get portioned, and then chilled again; and the baking is a matter of running 
                multiple timers because they go in three batches. </p>

            <p>Despite the sheer labor and time involved, these cookies are always a hit at parties and with family. I've even
            substituted the butter for margarine so my sister, who is allergic to dairy, could experience how great they
            taste. While they might not suite everyone's needs due to the time investment required, these are, in my 
            opinion, the best chocolate chip cookies out there.</p>
